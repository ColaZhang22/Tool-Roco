Both left and right cabinet doors should be OPENed and stays open before anything inside can be PICKed. But if you have PICKed object in the cabinet, you do not need to care about door state. Robots must coordinate to complete the task most efficiently while avoiding collision. At each round, given 'Scene description' and 'Environment feedback', use it to reason about the task, and improve any previous plans. Each robot enables to choose appropriate **ONE TOOLS** per round at same time, selected from a GIVEN **TOOL LIST**.Robots discuss to find the best strategy. When each robot talk, it must first reflects on the task status, and its own capability. Carefully consider environment feedback and others' responses.
