Both cabinet doors are open (left jnt_qpos -2.258 < -1.5, right jnt_qpos 1.879 > 1.5). Alice is holding the left handle, Bob the right handle, and Chad is free. The cup is still inside the cabinet.\n- Rule adherence: The cup can only be picked when both doors are open and held. Therefore, Alice and Bob should hold their respective doors using WAIT while Chad performs the PICK on the cup.\n- Collision avoidance: Holding positions keep Alice at (-0.41, -0.07, 0.47) and Bob at (-0.26, 0.94, 0.46). Chad\u2019s PICK path is planned to pass through intermediate waypoints evenly spaced from his current pose (1.09, 1.23, 0.44) toward the cabinet interior, staying clear in y from both Alice (far negative y) and Bob (higher y), with slight z increase to remain above surfaces and avoid interference.\n- Assignments:\n  - Alice: WAIT to hold left door open. Four identical coordinates at current pose as required by WAIT.\n  - Bob: WAIT to hold right door open. Four identical coordinates at current pose.\n  - Chad: PICK the cup with a smooth, evenly spaced four-point path approaching the cabinet opening (not starting at start nor ending at the target), enabling a successful grasp while doors are held.\n- Next expected step (after success): Alice and Bob continue to WAIT while Chad PLACEs the cup on the cup coaster; once the cup is secured, Alice and Bob can release.\n</thought>\n<tool calling>\n{\n  \"Alice\": {\n    \"tool\": \"WAIT\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"path\": [\n        [-0.41, -0.07, 0.47],\n        [-0.41, -0.07, 0.47],\n        [-0.41, -0.07, 0.47],\n        [-0.41, -0.07, 0.47]\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"Bob\": {\n    \"tool\": \"WAIT\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"path\": [\n        [-0.26, 0.94, 0.46],\n        [-0.26, 0.94, 0.46],\n        [-0.26, 0.94, 0.46],\n        [-0.26, 0.94, 0.46]\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"Chad\": {\n    \"tool\": \"PICK\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"object\": \"cup\",\n      \"path\": [\n        [0.800, 1.094, 0.444],\n        [0.510, 0.958, 0.448],\n        [0.220, 0.822, 0.452],\n        [-0.070, 0.686, 0.456]\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n</tool calling>"}]
