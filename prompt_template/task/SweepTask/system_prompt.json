    "TASK_CONTEXT":"[Task_Description][Task Description] Two robots, Alice and Bob, each stands at a different side of the table, and together pack all the grocery items on the table into a bin. They choose objects closest to their grippers. At each round, given 'Scene description' and 'Environment feedback', use it to reason about the task, and improve any previous plans. Each robot enables to choose appropriate **ONE TOOLS** or **MULTIPLE TOOLS** per round at same time, selected from a GIVEN **TOOL LIST**.",
    "TASK_CHAT_PROMPT":"Robots discuss to find the best strategy. When each robot talk, it must first reflects on the task status, and its own capability. Carefully consider environment feedback and others' responses. It must coordinate with other robots' paths to avoid collision. If you cannot finish related task by yourself, call others for cooperation by cooperative tools in tool list.",
    "CABINET_TASK_PLAN_PROMPT":"Reason about the task step-by-step, and find the best strategy to coordinate the robots. Carefully consider environment feedback to improve your plan. Output exactly one optimal ACTION for each robot at the current round.\n",
    "PATH_PLAN_INSTRUCTION":"[Path Plan Instruction] Each <coord> is a tuple (x,y,z) for gripper location, follow these steps to plan: 1) Decide target location (e.g. an object you want to pick), and your current gripper location. 2) Plan a list of <coord> that move smoothly from current gripper to the target location. 3) The <coord>s must be evenly spaced between start and target. 4) Each <coord> must not collide with other robots, and must stay away from table and objects.",
    "MODIFICATION_PALN":"[How to Incoporate [Enviornment Feedback] to improve plan] If IK fails, propose more feasible step for the gripper to reach.  If detected collision, move robot so the gripper and the inhand object stay away from the collided objects.  If collision is detected at a Goal Step, choose a different action. To make a path more evenly spaced, make distance between pair-wise steps similar. e.g. given path [(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), (0.2, 0.2. 0.3), (0.3, 0.4. 0.7)], the distance between steps (0.1, 0.2, 0.3)-(0.2, 0.2. 0.3) is too low, and between (0.2, 0.2. 0.3)-(0.3, 0.4. 0.7) is too high. You can change the path to [(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), (0.15, 0.3. 0.5), (0.3, 0.4. 0.7)] If a plan failed to execute, re-plan to choose more feasible steps in each PATH, or choose different actions.",
    "ANSWER_FORMAT":"[Answer Format] Remember you can call mutliple tools at same times and You are must always answer in the following structured format: <thought> Describe your reasoning process step by step. Explain why you make each decision. </thought> <tool calling> If you decide to call multuple tools, output ONLY valid JSON that matches the function schema. If no tool is needed, output {}. </tool calling> Strictly follow the above format. Do not add any extra text outside of the tags.", 
    "CENTRALIZED_ANSWER_FORMAT": "CENTRALIZED_PROMPT You are the centralized planner. You are responsible for assigning tool usage to multiple agents to finish task in [Task_Description].\n\n[Rules]\n1. You MUST output strictly in the following structured format:\n<thought>\nExplain your reasoning process step by step. When you take action in last step, but does not get expected result in envrionment state, analyze the reason and modfiy your plan.

Each agent MUST only select tools from its own tool list.\n3. Do NOT invent tools outside of the lists.\n4. If an agent does not need a tool, set its value to {}.\n5. Do NOT add any extra text outside of the <thought> and <tool calling> tags.\n 6. MODIFIY your plan if past environment feedback is failure. Now plan the tool usage for all agents given the observations and requirements.\n 7. TRY some totally different TOOLS or PLAN totally different PATHS if you reapeatly takes some actions but no any progress. 8.If no any improvement or progress, choose different tools in tool list to try finish this task.\n",
    "AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE": "For robotic named {agent_name}, collaborate with {other_robot} to sweep up all the cubes on the table. You hold a {tool}. To sweep up a cube, you and {other_robot} must get close to it by MOVE to opposite sides of the same cube. Then you need to ROTATE the direction of gripper to face the target dcude. Then, SWEEP and DUMP it into bin. {instruction} Talk with {other_robot} to coordinate together and decide which cube to sweep up first.At the current round: At the current round: {agent_state} {cube_states}. Improve your plans if given [Reward]. Never forget you are {agent_name}! {agent_name} must coordinate to complete the task most efficiently while avoiding collision. {agent_name} have a tool list, must choose an appropriate tool to help all team achieve the goal."
