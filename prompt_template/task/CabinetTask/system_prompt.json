    "TASK_CONTEXT":"[Task_Description]3 robots, Alice, Bob, Chad together must take a MUG and a CUP and place them on the correct coasters. The CUP is in the cabinet and the MUG is on the table. CUP should be take out of a cabinet and then place to the CUP COASTER. And MUG can be directly picked and placeed to the MUG COASTER. Both left and right cabinet doors should be OPENed and stays open before anything inside can be PICKed. But if you have PICKed object in the cabinet, you do not need to care about door state. Robots must coordinate to complete the task most efficiently while avoiding collision. At each round, given 'Scene description' and 'Environment feedback', use it to reason about the task, and improve any previous plans. Each robot enables to choose appropriate **ONE TOOLS** per round at same time, selected from a GIVEN **TOOL LIST**.",
    "TASK_CHAT_PROMPT":"Robots discuss to find the best strategy. When each robot talk, it must first reflects on the task status, and its own capability. Carefully consider environment feedback and others' responses. It must coordinate with other robots' paths to avoid collision. If you cannot finish related task by yourself, call others for cooperation by cooperative tools in tool list.",
    "TASK_PLAN_PROMPT":"Reason about the task step-by-step, and find the best strategy to coordinate the robots. Carefully consider environment feedback to improve your plan. Output exactly one optimal ACTION for each robot at the current round.\n",
    "PATH_PLAN_INSTRUCTION":"[Path Plan Instruction] Each <coord> is a tuple (x,y,z) for gripper location, follow these steps to plan: 1) Decide target location (e.g. an object you want to pick), and your current gripper location. 2) Plan a list of <coord> that move smoothly from current gripper to the target location. 3) The <coord>s must be evenly spaced between start and target. 4) Each <coord> must not collide with other robots, and must stay away from table and objects.",
    "MODIFICATION_PALN":"[How to Incoporate [Enviornment Feedback] to improve plan] If IK fails, propose more feasible step for the gripper to reach.  If detected collision, move robot so the gripper and the inhand object stay away from the collided objects.  If collision is detected at a Goal Step, choose a different action. To make a path more evenly spaced, make distance between pair-wise steps similar. e.g. given path [(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), (0.2, 0.2. 0.3), (0.3, 0.4. 0.7)], the distance between steps (0.1, 0.2, 0.3)-(0.2, 0.2. 0.3) is too low, and between (0.2, 0.2. 0.3)-(0.3, 0.4. 0.7) is too high. You can change the path to [(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), (0.15, 0.3. 0.5), (0.3, 0.4. 0.7)] If a plan failed to execute, re-plan to choose more feasible steps in each PATH, or choose different actions.",
