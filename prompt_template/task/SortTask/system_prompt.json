    "TASK_CONTEXT":"[Task_Description]7 panels on the table, ordered left to right: panel1,...,panel7. They form a straight assembly line, panel1 is closed to panel2 and farthest from panel7. There are 3 cubes, each robot must place their cube on the correct target, their (cube, target_panel) pairs: Alice: (blue_square, panel2),  Bob: (pink_polygon, panel4),  Chad: (yellow_trapezoid, panel6). The coordination of panal1 is [-1.2 0.5 0.3], panal2 is [-0.8 0.5 0.3], panal3 is [-0.4 0.5 0.3], panal4 is [0 0.5 0.3] and panal5 is [0.4 0.5 0.3], panal6 is [0.8 0.5 0.3], panal7 is [1.2 0.5 0.3]. There are 3 robots, each with a limited reach range, this means they can only firstly pick cubes from these panels, and then move or place these cubes on some appropriate MIDDLE COORDINATIONS. Then, other robots pick this cubes again and place into other panels. Each robot can just move to somewhere to avoid path collision. The (robot, [reachable_panels]) pairs: (Alice, [panel1, panel2, panel3]) (Bob, [panel3, panel4, panel5])(Chad, [panel5, panel6, panel7]) The valid range of Alice is x=(-1.4, -0.1), y=(0.1, 1.3), z=(0.16, 1), of Bob is (-0.7, 0.7), y=(-0.21, 1.3), z=(0.16, 1)), of Chad is x=(0.2, 1.5), y=(0.1, 1.3), z=(0.16, 1). At each round, given 'Scene description' and 'Environment feedback', use it to reason about the task, and improve any previous plans. Each robot enables to choose appropriate **ONE TOOLS** or **MULTIPLE TOOLS** per round at same time, selected from a GIVEN **TOOL LIST**.",
    "TASK_CHAT_PROMPT":"Robots discuss to find the best strategy. When each robot talk, it must first reflects on the task status, and its own capability. Carefully consider environment feedback and others' responses. It must coordinate with other robots' paths to avoid collision. If you cannot finish related task by yourself, call others for cooperation by cooperative tools in tool list.",

    "PATH_PLAN_INSTRUCTION":"[Path Plan Instruction] Each <coord> is a tuple (x,y,z) for gripper location, follow these steps to plan: 1) Decide target location (e.g. an object you want to pick), and your current gripper location. 2) Plan a list of <coord> that move smoothly from current gripper to the target location. 3) The <coord>s must be evenly spaced between start and target. 4) Each <coord> must not collide with other robots, and must stay away from table and objects.",
    "MODIFICATION_PALN":"[How to Incoporate [Enviornment Feedback] to improve plan] If IK fails, propose more feasible step for the gripper to reach.  If detected collision, move robot so the gripper and the inhand object stay away from the collided objects.  If collision is detected at a Goal Step, choose a different action. To make a path more evenly spaced, make distance between pair-wise steps similar. e.g. given path [(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), (0.2, 0.2. 0.3), (0.3, 0.4. 0.7)], the distance between steps (0.1, 0.2, 0.3)-(0.2, 0.2. 0.3) is too low, and between (0.2, 0.2. 0.3)-(0.3, 0.4. 0.7) is too high. You can change the path to [(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), (0.15, 0.3. 0.5), (0.3, 0.4. 0.7)] If a plan failed to execute, re-plan to choose more feasible steps in each PATH, or choose different actions.",
